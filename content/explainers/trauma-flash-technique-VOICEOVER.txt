"Living with trauma means your brain keeps replaying the same painful memories... over and over."

[0:04-0:09]
"Traditional therapy asks you to relive those moments. But there's a better way."

[0:09-0:14]
"The Flash Technique lets you process trauma without feeling the pain. Clinically proven. Doctor approved."

[0:14-0:19]
"You focus on something peaceful while your brain does the healing work in the background. No reliving. No retraumatization."

[0:19-0:24]

VOICEOVER SCRIPT:
-----------------

[0:00-0:04]
"Your brain is lying to you. Every single day. And you don't even know it."

[0:04-0:09]
"It's called cognitive bias. Your mind takes shortcuts. Distorts reality. Makes you see threats that don't exist."

[0:09-0:14]
"Negativity bias makes you focus on what's wrong. Confirmation bias keeps you stuck in the same beliefs."

[0:14-0:18]
"And the worst part? You can't see it happening. You need AI to catch what your mind hides."

[0:18-0:23]
"Matcha spots every bias in real-time. Shows you the truth your brain won't let you see."

[0:23-0:27]
"Stop living in distortion. See reality clearly. Try Matcha free."

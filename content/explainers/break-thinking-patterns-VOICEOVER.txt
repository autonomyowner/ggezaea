TIKTOK EXPLAINER: Break Toxic Thinking Patterns
================================================

TOTAL DURATION: 26 seconds
ELEVENLABS VOICE: Rachel (empowering, warm, motivational)
SETTINGS: Stability 0.6 | Clarity 0.75 | Style 0.35

VOICEOVER SCRIPT:
-----------------

[0:00-0:04]
"That voice in your head? The one that says you're not good enough? It's a pattern. Not the truth."

[0:04-0:08]
"Your brain learned it years ago. Now it runs on autopilot. Sabotaging every good thing."

[0:08-0:13]
"All-or-nothing thinking. Catastrophizing. Overgeneralizing. These aren't personality traits. They're bugs in your code."

[0:13-0:17]
"And just like code, they can be rewritten. Matcha identifies the pattern. Then shows you how to break it."

[0:17-0:22]
"One thought at a time. One pattern at a time. Until the voice changes."

[0:22-0:26]
"Stop fighting your mind. Reprogram it. Start with Matcha."

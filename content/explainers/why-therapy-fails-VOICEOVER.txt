====================================================

TOTAL DURATION: 22 seconds
ELEVENLABS VOICE: Adam (authoritative, confident, direct)
SETTINGS: Stability 0.6 | Clarity 0.85 | Style 0.5

VOICEOVER SCRIPT:
-----------------

[0:00-0:04]
"You've been in therapy for months. Maybe years. But nothing's changed. You're still stuck."

[0:04-0:08]
"Here's why. Traditional therapy asks you to talk about your problems. But talking isn't healing."

[0:08-0:13]
"Your brain needs action, not words. It needs patterns broken, not just discussed."

[0:13-0:18]
"That's why Matcha uses proven techniques. Flash for trauma. CBT for thinking. Real-time insights that actually work."

[0:18-0:22]
"Stop talking in circles. Start breaking patterns. Real progress starts now."

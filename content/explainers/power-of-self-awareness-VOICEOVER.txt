VOICEOVER SCRIPT:
-----------------

[0:00-0:04]
"Most people go through life never understanding why they react the way they do. They just... exist."

[0:04-0:08]
"But the most powerful people? They know themselves. Deeply. Completely."

[0:08-0:12]
"Self-awareness isn't just nice to have. It's the difference between being controlled by your patterns and controlling them."

[0:12-0:17]
"When you see your biases, your triggers, your patterns... you get a choice. React the old way, or choose something new."

[0:17-0:21]
"That's freedom. That's growth. That's what Matcha gives you every single day."

[0:21-0:25]
"Stop being a passenger. Take the wheel. Start your journey with Matcha."
